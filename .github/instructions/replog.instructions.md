use Services from the `services` folder for all data fetching and manipulation

prefer simple implementations over complex ones

prefer creating components over implementing features in the page

extract services and components into their own files

dont use null and undefined values unless necessary

if you need to implement types and interfaces, try to use the ones already implemented in the project maybe in services folder.

use advanced typescript features. you can use `typeof` and `keyof` to create more precise types.

never write tests
